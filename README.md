Casual-talks is a messaging website. Users can join anonymously, enter a room (a room is a place where users chat on a based topic ), or create another one, with their preferred topic. 
The website is made using react.
I used Google firebase for storing the messages. I used a non-SQL database with an API to perform CRUD operations.
